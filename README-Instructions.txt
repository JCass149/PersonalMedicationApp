Instructions:
1.) The single executable .jar file named "PMAPrototype" should run the whole system as long as the
"MedicineInformation.csv" file and the "Resources" folder are in the same directory (as submitted).
On the University Computers double clicking the .jar file runs it, however on another computer
the 'run.bat' file may need to be ran to run the program.

2.) If you wish to look at the Junit test the file is called "DosageUnitTest.java" located in the src folder.
There is a button within the system itself on the 'Calculations' page (acessed through the Profile page) which 
runs the JUnit Test which prints out the results to the System, and also displays them on screen.
 
3.) When adding a medication to the profile, this is saved and stored for the current session, however this
is NOT permanently saved to the .csv data file and therefore will not be present for the next session.
This is as discussed, and confirmed to be valid with Sarah Drummond on 23/02/2017 at roughly 12:30.
